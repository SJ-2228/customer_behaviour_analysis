Data Analytics Project Showcasing Customer Behaviour Analysis using Python, Sql, and Power BI

Data Analytics Project
🔎 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow. Starting from raw data, it covers loading and exploration in Python, cleaning and transformation, SQL querying for deeper insights, and visualization through Power BI. Finally, the findings are summarized in a professional report and presented in a Gamma-powered presentation.
The goal is to showcase technical proficiency, analytical thinking, and storytelling skills in a way that is clear and impactful for business stakeholders.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data loading, EDA, cleaning
- SQL (MySQL Workbench / SQL Server) → Querying and relational analysis
- Power BI → Interactive dashboards and KPIs
- Gamma → Final presentation slides
- Excel/Word → Report documentation

📈 Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was built to:
- Visualize key metrics and trends
- Enable interactive filtering (by time, category, etc.)
- Provide executive-ready insights for decision-making

📝 Steps
- Load Dataset in Python
- Import data using Pandas
- Inspect structure and missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Visualizations (distributions, correlations, trends)
- Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values
- Normalize/transform fields
- Remove duplicates and inconsistencies
- SQL Queries
- Run queries in MySQL Workbench / SQL Server
- Aggregate, filter, and join tables for insights
- Power BI Dashboard
- Import cleaned dataset
- Build visuals (charts, KPIs, slicers)
- Publish dashboard
- Report Creation
- Document methodology, findings, and recommendations
- Gamma Presentation
- Summarize results in a recruiter-friendly, visually appealing presentation

📊 Results
- Identified [insert key insights, e.g., top-performing products, customer segments, seasonal trends]
- Built a dashboard that highlights [KPIs, metrics]
- Delivered a clear report and presentation for stakeholders

▶️ How to Run
- Clone this repository.
- Install required Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
- Load dataset into Python and run Jupyter Notebook for EDA.
- Import cleaned dataset into MySQL/SQL Server and execute queries.
